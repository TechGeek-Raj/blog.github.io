         <p>Waking up to a big red zit in the morning - the most dreadful thing ever! With some people, it happens more than often if they have acne-prone skin. Acne can be persistent and sometimes, no amount of medications can make them vanish for good. It keeps coming back. But do you know what can actually make it stop in its tracks? Your diet! What we eat feeds our skin too and reflects on it. A bad diet can aggravate the problem of acne and a good diet can help prevent it. Dietitian Kanupreet Arora Narang has suggested some dos and don'ts for skin diet that can help prevent the recurrence of acne. </p>

              <h1>What Causes Acne? How Does Acne Happen?</h1>
              
              <p>Acne occurs when skin pores, connected to oil glands beneath the skin, become blocked. This blockage leads to the buildup of oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria, resulting in inflammation and the formation of acne lesions. Factors like hormones, genetics, and stress contribute to acne development.</p>

                <h1>Here Are 5 Diet Mistakes To Avoid For Skin Health: </h1>
              <h2>1. Stay Away From Foods With High Glycemic Index </h2>
             
             
              <p>High GI index foods tend to raise blood sugar levels faster, which leads to inflammation that produces acne on the skin. Avoid refined carbs and highly processed foods like white bread, pasta, macaroni and cheese. </p>
            </div>
         <div class="artical-content">
            <div class="group-1">
              <h2>2. Cut Down On Fried Foods</h2>
              
              <p>Unhealthy saturated and trans fats in fried foods are known to trigger inflammation, which is a leading cause of skin problems. Limit your intake of fried foods and even processed baked goods to once in a while. </p>

              <h2>3. Stop Having Too Much Milk</h2>
             
             
              <p>Milk and milk products have been shown to raise insulin levels, which may propel the production of pimples. Some studies also claim that the growth hormones already present in milk may throw off the body's hormone balance and increase oil production.</p>

         <div class="artical-content">
            <div class="group-1">
              <h2>4. Say No To Sweets</h2>
              
              <p>Refined sugar can also be the culprit, so try to avoid it as much as possible. Sugar can trigger the two major causes of acne - hormones and inflammation. While natural sugars found in fruits may not be the problem, refined sugar in desserts, cookies, chocolates etc. is.</p>

              <h2>5. Don't Upset Your Tummy </h2>
             
              <p>A bad stomach means bad skin. You would have noticed that whenever you have diarrhoea or constipation, acne erupts on your face. This says it all. So avoid foods that your stomach can't take. Check our list of foods that you should avoid.</p>
