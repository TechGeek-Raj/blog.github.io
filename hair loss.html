         <p>Are you suffering from excessive hair fall? Are those tangled hair strands on the comb giving you nightmares? If yes, then it's time to buckle up and pay attention to your hair health. We understand the sight of dull and rough hair may trigger a frantic search for home remedies, with people resorting to expensive hair oils and shampoos. But what we often fail to realise is that our diet has a crucial role to play. It is rightly said, we are what we eat and there are a variety of food ingredients to prevent hair fall and promote hair growth as well. The best part is, you do not need to go miles to get hold of those foods; instead, scan through your kitchen pantry and pick a jar of cinnamon. You heard us. </p>
