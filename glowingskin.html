              <h1>Tips to get natural glowing skin</h1>
              <h2>Moisturize properly after washing your face</h2>
              
              <p>Properly moisturizing your skin is essential to keeping it healthy and glowing. After washing your face, apply a moisturizer that is suitable for your skin type. Moisturizing helps to keep the skin hydrated and protects it from environmental damage.
